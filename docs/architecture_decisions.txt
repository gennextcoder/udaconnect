Design considerations
------ --------------
1. Moved the endpoints pertaining to connections, locations and persons to separate microservices.
2. Because the volume of location data to be ingested could be huge, the POST endpoint in the locations service has been replaced with
a) a GRPC based kafka producer which writes location data on a kafka topic
b) a kafka consumer which reaction the location data from the said topic and writes them to the DB.
This way, the database would not be overloaded.
3. The connections service requests the persons and locations related data from the respective microservices instead of reading
from the database directly. This was done to keep the services loosely coupled.
