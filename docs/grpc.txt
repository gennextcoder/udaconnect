Below is the proto schema being used by the GRPC based Kafka producer (locations_grpc_kafka_producer) which receives location data and writes them to a kafka topic. The service listens on port 5005. However, applications running outside the kubernetes cluster need to use port 30004 to connect to the service.


syntax = "proto3";

message LocationMessage {
    int64 id = 1;
    int64 person_id = 2;
    string latitude = 3;
    string longitude = 4;
    string creation_time = 5;
}

service LocationService {
    rpc Create(LocationMessage) returns (LocationMessage);
}


How to make a sample request
--- -- ---- - ------ -------
kubectl exec --stdin --tty $(kubectl get pods | grep producer | awk '{print $1}') -- python3 writer.py

This will run the client script residing inside the grpc based kafka producer's container. The script sends a location sample to the GRPC server.
